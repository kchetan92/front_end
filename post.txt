The best way to learn something is by doing it, I couldn't agree less after the amazing experience at Haxter2, a 12 hour hackathon at GR Tech park, Bangalore. I am not a great fan of classroom teaching, and unless I prove it to my lazy brain that "Mate, this seems important, pick it up!" it prefers to travel light. I registered for Haxter2 because I wanted to motivate myself, see the experienced minds at work and subject myself to ad hoc learning. And I got more I could've ever asked for.

Being from an electronics background, I have learnt only Assembly and C at college. Complex and fun languages, but there wasn't much you could do with these languages unless you write a zillion lines of codes. Enter training phase at Sapient where I discovered JavaScript and within few hours I was already doing amazing stuff modifying static web pages and adding interactive components. And with JavaScript comes the dense forest of JS libraries and APIs spread all over the Internet. It is impossible to master all of them. When I first saw posters of Haxter2 put up all over the office space, I saw it as an opportunity to start my exploration in the woods of JS libraries and APIs.

While I was thinking of a good idea for the hackathon, my colleague Harish came up with a brilliant idea of developing a family tree application. The idea was simple and that's where the brilliance lies! In the age of nuclear families we aren't as close to our relatives as we should be. Our parents were much closer to their relatives than us. As most of us have left our villages and home towns in search of better opportunities in metropolitans in cities, we've lost touch with our distant cousins, uncles and aunts. And the solution is facebook. We've our relatives added on facebook and it shouldn't be difficult to actually link accounts and discover new relations. With this brilliant idea Harish Kulur, Debasish Shanti and me (Chetan K) formed the 'Gang of Tres' and registered for Haxter2.

The D Day : There should've been a paragraph before this titled 'Preparation for Haxter2', sadly there wasn't any so it's not there, and we soon realized the hard way that we should have. After a normal day at office, we reached 5th floor Vayu block to register for the event. The mood was good and spirits were high, we set out to inspect the battlefield watching experienced professionals delegating work, drawing complex diagrams and talking technical jargon. It was a delight watching the pros at work. According to the rules of Haxter2 personal laptops couldn't be connected to Sapient LAN for internet, and with our current knowledge we had to refer to google pretty often to even start working, so we didn't get any personal laptops. Although we wanted to be on the 5th floor to watch and learn from other teams we had to settle with workstations (Intel i7-4770 processor, 3.40GHz clock, and 16GB RAM! WOAH!!) on Takshashila Lab, 6th floor, Vayu Block. Not far from the battlefield.

After the initial kickoff by the senior members of Sapient, we started working
