•Responsive is for mobile technology
•Do not neglect any browser
•HTML5 shiv, modernizer, polyfill, conditional, CSS Media Query
	Webkit, moz, ms, o tags for CSS.
	If you don't specify engine, then w3c standards sould be used.
	w3c should be written in the end!
	webkit is faster than general w3c
•Social Media Plugins
•3D rendering
•Choose flat colors
•View switcher allows you to redirect the page to mobile version or desktop verion,  based on the user agent
•New category of device needs new website, new devices are coming
•Not possible to make a new websit for new devices
•Create once show anywhere - adaptive rendering (via CSS only)
•Do not use WYSIWYG editors, if you want responsive.
•Adding the following viewport meta tag with initial-scale set to 1...
----------------------------------

BOOTSTRAP

•UI framework
•Open Source
•Supports HTML5 and CSS3
•Supported by all major browsers
•Features of Bootstrap
	•Grid System
	•Lots of CSS components
	•JS Components
	•Web based components
•Uses 960 ggrid system
	•12 colums, 940px wide container (without responsive)
	•with responsive added, grid adapts to 724 or 1170 px, depending on viewport.
	•Each column is 60px wide with 20px to the left.
	•span1 class - occupies 12 columns
	•span12 class - occupies 1 column
	•span6 class - occupies 6 columns
	•span12,8,6,4,3,2,1 exists!
	•span should be put in div of class "row"

• ///References one.js 
• To statically include	one.js, like include

Q: responsive UI
-----------------------------------------------------------------
•Less is a CSS preprocessor
•Variables availaible for CSS
•LESS-C is a compiler for LESS
• filname.less --> lessc --> filename.css
•Others:Less,sass,stylus
•If working at client use:
	<link rel="stylesheet/less" type="text/css" href="styles.less"/>
	<script src="less.js">
•Less is closer to css as compared to sass


*******
less
*******

•Variables
	@primaryColor:#234fb4;
	@secondaryColor:#234489

	a{color:@primaryColor
	button	{
		background-color:@secondaryColor
	}
	}

•Mixins

	.border-radius(@radius) 	{
	background-color: #666;
	color:#fff;
	line-height: 20px;
	width:200px;
	padding:10px;

	-webkit-border-radius:@radius;
	-moz-border-radius:@radius;
	border-radius: @radius;
	}

	/*Implementation*/

	#somediv	{
		.border-radius(20px);
	}

•Less is superset of CSS
•Why LESS not SASS
	Less is
		•Faster
		•Uses Javascript which is universal
		•Based on CSS Syntax

•Some built in functions:
	lighten(@color,10%)
	darken(@color,10%)
	fadein(@color,30%)
	spin(@color,30%)

• #header{color:#32c2c3;
	.navigation{font-size:12px;}
	.logo{widtg:300px
		&:hover	{
			text-decoration:underline
		}
	}
}

•Angular vs Backbone
	•First JS framework was dozo
	•GWT used by google. Popular among JAVA developers
	•jQuery appeared in 2002. Fast concise, extendable, testable, for DOM manipulations
	•$.fn.my_function = function(){...} to extend..

	•Backbone depends on jQuery and underscore.
	•Has no DOM manipulation.
	•Backbone is used for JS based SPA (it makes ajax calls, mV* family)
	•web apps for dynamic content
	•HTML is not extended---Backbone creates
	•jQuery support. Supports jQuery, jQUI
	•Two way data binding is supported!
	•Used jQuery AJAX!

	•Angular JS supports MVC, MVVM
	•Steep learning curve.
	•Dependency Injection at runtime. Loosely coupled and flexible. (Not available in Backbone)
	•Poor Documentation :( 
	•Poor support
	•Extends existing HTML pages fro WebApps
	•Very well extensible,
	•Support by Google
	•Works on jQLite

Progressive Enhancement - see the webaccessibility.ppt

Any modification should be inherited.

Ajax Patterns : 
	•Periodic fetch
	•Perdictive fetch - as user scrolls, the rest of the page loads

Build Process (GRUNT for Angular)

•Validate the code (JSLint)
•Remove unneccessary whitspace
•Replace strings inside your scripts - this saves file size
•Collate several includes into a single file
•Check your code for security vulerabilities
•Bundling is the process of combining all js in gzip, like all_classes.gz

---------------------------------------------------------
Web Accessibility - for the specially abled, older people
---------------------------------------------------------
•All commands must be accessible via keyboard

Assistive Technology
•Blindness and Accessibility: features to contrast and brightness of screens


----------------------------------
Client/Server applications
----------------------------------


URL : Uniform Resource Locator
---------------
Access Control
---------------

1.	Authentication
2.	Authorization
3.	Confidentiality
4.	Integrity

cookies for login
-----------------

cookie is created at server! cookie is sent repeatedly.
Authentication cookie contains a 64bit secret which cannot be guessed.
It is valid for only 10 minutes

Whenever a link is clicked, a new secret is given.
State at client - cookies
State at server - session

cookies - small amount of data, doesn't need to be kept secret
session - 


Server architecture
RPC - remote procedure call
DCOM -  distributed 
RMI - remote method invocation (BANK)
CORBA - Common Object Request Broker Architecture - Should be accessible from C++, JAVA, C#
			but .NET couldn't support CORBA, as Microsoft was being a bitch.

Interoperability - Web Services

-----------------------------

HTML + XML = SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol), can be understood by all!
Send SOAP request and get a SOAP response

WSDL - Web service description language
XSD - XML Schema Definition
UDDI - advertisement

Web Services - WSDL + XSD + UDDI

Distroibuted Technology Styles
RPC - Remote Procedure Calls
SOA - Service Oriented Architecture
REST - Representational State Transfer

REST - uses JSON
Web Services - uses XML

Architecture SOA______________ (Publish Find Bind)
UDDI server - Hosts Advertisements (they're not search engines), sites have to fimd them manually

----------------------------
WSDL - Access data from Backend
Web Service Definition Language

•WSDL is written in XML, so that backend can be written in any language
•WSDl is used to locate and describe service
•$.ajax({
	url:"http://www.webservicesx.net/GetQuote?Symbol="+S;
	method : 'get';
	content_type : 'text/xml'
	success : function()	{
		alert('yes');
	}
})

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
JS Lint - jslint.com

•Better than firebug.
•Linter tools checks quality.
•Checks for errors without actually running the script
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AJAX

Asynchronous JavaScript and XML

XHR/AJAX Engine -  XmlHttpRequest

$ajax({
	url:"http://localhost:8000/HRService.asmx/GetEmployeeCount?department="+'sales';
	method:'get';
	content_type:'text/plain';
	Success:function(result)	{
		alert(result);
	}
	fail:function(result)	{
		alert(result);
	}
});
