        		<p>Sapient was founded on November 6, 1990. The two founders, Jerry Greenberg and Stuart Moore, met at Cambridge Technology Partners, an IT services company located in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The co-founders recognized the need for a different type of firm in the IT consulting world. Rather than charge on a time and materials basis like other firms, Sapient chose to use a fixed-term, fixed-price model for pricing projects. In addition, Greenberg and Moore relied on their own money instead of venture capital to fund the companyâ€™s operations. This allowed them to keep control of the organization and set long-term strategic goals. Within a few years, Sapient gained a reputation for completing complex projects to the satisfaction of its clients. During this period, Sapient was also an early adopter of internet-based technology, and internet-based work grew to over 70% of total revenue by 1999. Both client satisfaction and the pioneering use of the internet led to rapid growth in the period from 1992-2000, with revenue growing from $950,000 in 1992 to $503 million in 2000.[2]</p>
